String, StringBuilder, StringBuffer

What is String?
- String internally char[]
e.g: String name = "Ram";
char name[] = {'R', 'a', 'm'};

-String is a predefine class in java, So it has lot of predefine functions/methods
inside the class
e.g: uppercase, lowercase, indexOf, split, equals, length
-It is also treat like a Data Type.
e.g: String name = "Ram";
-String is a final class, so you can't inherit.
-String objects are created in 2 ways:
1) String Literal Style
e.g: String name "Ram";

2)String Object Style
String name = new String("Ram");

-String use String Pool
-String Objects are immutable/UnChangeable

Immutable: Strng doesn't change existing or original objects, it can create new memory 
or object all the time.

But String Buffer is mutable that means it doesn't create new objects or memory

String Buffer:

Capacity Cross
Old Cap * 2 + 2
16 * 2 + 2 = 34

90 * 2 + 2 = 182
