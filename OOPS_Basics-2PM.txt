2 major types of programming:

- Procedural - Functions - Divide a problem into functions
- OOPs (Object Oriented Programming Language) - Wrap all the variables and functions into a single unit - class

Why OOPS?
In C Programming:

int x, y;

add()
{}
sub()
{}
div()
{}
mul()
{}

sin()
{
 double x;
}

Solution:
Wrap global variables in brackets in C++

class A
{
int x, y;
add()
{}
sub()
{}
div()
{}
mul()
{}
}

class B
{
sin()
{
 double x;
}
}

Is Java has Global Variable?
- No, because in java every program start with class, and class doesn,t have global variable.

What is OOPS?
-Divide a Big problem into classes.
OOPs Features:
1. Class, Object
object - real world entity
e.g. AC, Car, Projector, Fan
e.g. amit, ram, shyam 
Classes - Collection of similar objects
e.g. Human (features brain, height, 2 ears)
object - ram state brain sharp, 6 feet height

//Student, Employee

class Student {

}
