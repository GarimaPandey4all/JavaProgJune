creating first program in java

- Every java program start with class
- class name should start with capital letter
- class name should be same as file name
- class name starts with either aplhabet or special symbol(_, $)

javac filename.java
-compile the code

java <bytecode/classname>
-execute/run the code

javac comes from jdk
java comes from JRE, JRE starts searching for main

Main Method
- main is a entry point of every java program
- without main java will compile the code convert it into byte code
	can't execute the code or interpret the code
	
4 types of scopes in java
public - global, which is accessible for all , from anywhere
private - accessible within the class only
protected - can be accessed inside the package/folder, can also be accessed outside the package by using inheritance
default - It is not a reserved keyword, if you will not specify any scope then it is default. The scope cane be accessed by any class but within the package.

Why main is public?
-JRE uses main : java<bytecode>
-Java command trigger the JRE
-JRE load your class in the memory
-JRE is looking for main
-JRE is outside from your directory/folder/package
-And outside the package things can access

Why main is static?
-Static things are loaded into memory when class is loaded.

Why main is void?
-main is void in nature
-main is entry point so there is no need to return anything

Main arguments - String args[]

-main has command line arguments
for e.g: copy xyz.txt abc.txt
-copy is a command and xyz.txt and anc abc.txt are arguments

What is command line arguments?
- we can make our commands
for e.g. wish happy birthday
-we can pass any number of arguments, that's why it is array
-All arguments are pass to main in form of array of string

What is String?

-String is a collection of class
-String internally is a char[]
-String is a predefined class in java as it is in capital letter

What is System.out.println?
-println(): print in new line, println comes 'out' object
-out: out is an predefined object, which belongs to PrintStream class
-System is a predefined class used for input, output and error
System.in, System.out, System.err

Println vs Print
- println: print in new line
- print: here cursor remains at the end of the text

Can we overload main()?
-Yes, we can overload the main
-When we execute the class, JVM starts execution with public static void main(String args[])
