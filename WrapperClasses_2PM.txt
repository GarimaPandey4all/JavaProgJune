Wrapper Class

- Wrapper class is a class whose object wraps or contains primitive data types.
e.g. String is a wrapper class as it wraps char[]

Need of Wrapper Class

- They convert primitive data types into objects. Objects are needed if we wish to modify the arguments passed into a method.

Autoboxing and Unboxing

Autoboxing: Automatic convertion of primitive data types to the object of their corresponding wrapper classes is known as autoboxing.

e.g- int into Integer, long to Long etc


Unboxing: It is the reverse process of autoboxing.

e.g- Integer to int, Character to char etc
