Inheritance:

1. In Development
-One Class One File (SRP)
-If your class is public so class name must be same as file name
-So in one file we can n non public classes
If one file (X.java) has 3 classes e.g
class X() {} ,  class Y() {}, class Z {}
After compile it will create 3 byte codes
X.class, Y.class, Z.class
